Skyscanner Front-End Software Engineering virtual experience programme on Forage.

 * Completed a job simulation where I built a web application using React as a
   front-end engineer at Skyscanner.
 * Developed a page for picking a travel date using Skyscanner’s open-source
   Backpack React library.
 * Customised my application and ran automated tests to ensure it rendered
   properly.
   
I recently participated in Skyscanner’s job simulation on Forage and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a front-end engineering team there. During the job simulation I used Skyscanner’s open-source React library called Backpack to build and customise a simple web page for users to select a travel date and I then ran automated tests. Completing this simulation helped me to validate my passion for front-end engineering. What I loved was building an application and thinking about how my work could be utilised by hundreds of millions of people all around the world to make it simpler and cheaper for them to enjoy travel and see different parts of the world. Seeing how Skyscanner contributes to the open-source community was also really exciting. I’d love to apply what I’ve learned from this experience in a front-end engineering team.
